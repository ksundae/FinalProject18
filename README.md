Based off the traditional card game, this digital remake of blackjack is a single player game in which the user, or the player, competes against the computer, or the dealer. Just like the original game, the player will try to assemble a hand with a value of 21 points or below that will still beat the value of the dealer's hand. Each turn, the player will decide to either hit, to add another card to their hand, or stand, to stop taking cards and compare their total value to the dealer's total. All cards will come from a standard 52 card deck each round, without the use of any jokers or repeats. Due to a G rating of this game, no betting will be involved. A website with the rules will be included below, but a full, simplified set of rules are available within the game. This game is interactive and involves the entering of answers through the keyboard.
